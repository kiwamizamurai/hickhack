I've been engrossed in Security or Pure computer like x86_64. Fortunately, Python is one of the language for Hacking, so it makes it easy for me to get started due to the fact that I've been studying Python.

# Prerequisites

I think the following skills are required if you want to proceed without difficulty.

  1. VirtualBox
  2. Linux Basic
  3. Python Basic
